# MERNG-Social-Media-APP


This application is disbbaled for now due to restrictions on deployment. I have crossed my limit of maximum of 5 apps for free deployment. I will recreate this project with new additional features in future with more styling components and make the site activated.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.linkpicture.com/q/homepage.png)

Star‚≠ê the repo if you like what you seeüòâ.

Full stack, fully-featured social media application using MERNG Stack( MongoDB, Express, React, Node, GraphQL) and Semantic-UI for the User Interface.  

Implemented a GraphQL server that using Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to a social media app backend.

To Register: Make any username annd email you want(It should have the @ usual regex in it), password and confirm password should be same , otherwise it raises the error!!

Working Sample Account: userx, userx@email.com, Password : 123456, Confirm password : 123456.

If you have already registered, you can loin with the same creds you gave for registration otherwise it displays the error!!

#### For deployment ,we will be using Netlify for frontend that is from ReactJs code. And for node js and express we will be using Heroku.

* The merng-client folder contains the client code and it is deployed in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)  - One of the best tools for automating modern web projects.
* The merng-server folder contains server related code including authentication and it is deployed in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - platform as a service (PaaS) tool that  operates applications entirely in the cloud.

The list of resources that I used for building this project are listed in the acknowledgements.
